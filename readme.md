About this small Project:  
Language used: Python  
IDE: VS code

Students in primary school often arrange arithmetic problems vertically to make them easier to solve. For example, "235 + 52" becomes:

```
    235

  +  52
    ----
```

Create the arithmetic_arranger function that receives a list of strings which are arithmetic problems, and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. The function should optionally take a second argument. When the second argument is set to True, the answers should be displayed.
